<p>Welcome to my website! My name is Sam Fewkes and I am currently a junior at Illinois State University. I started my educational journey at ISU as a Nursing Major, and after months of working as a CNA and getting a look into the industry I knew it wasnt for me...</p>

<p>After finding out nursing wasnt my thing I started thinking back to high school and what I enjoyed during my time there. I remembered all the engineering courses I took and how I loved being creative, but I knew I didnt want to be an engineer. I was having trouble pin pointing what exactly I wanted to pursue  until my aunt talked to me. My Aunt works at ISU as a the Assistant to the Director of the College of Fine Arts, and she talked to me about joining said major.</p>

<p>I thought about it for a while and it all made sense. I have always loved video games (heck I even stream them now!) and to combine my love for being creative with video games was a match made in heaven! Every since joining the CTK program I have never been happier with school and my interest has only grown. Last year I created my first ever video game (its a little rough around the edges, but its a start) and the classes i'm taking now are teaching me about sound design, video editing, web page development,  and so much more!</p>
<h2>Ambitions</h2>
<h3>Goals are an essential part of becoming successful and I have a lot of them!</h3>
<ul>
<li>1. <span class="white">Join a video game production studio thats working on a game im interested in.</span></li>
<li>2. <span class="white">Gain years of work experience and establish good connections/friendships.</span></li>
<li>3. <span class="white">Start my own studio to work on games I come up with (I have so many franchise game ideas).</span></li>
<li>4. <span class="white">While working towards the previous goals I am going to stream myself gaming.</span></li>
